Welcome to Prompt Science, the podcast exploring how artificial intelligence is reshaping the deepest questions in modern science. It’s the end of the first week of October 2025.
Today’s episode is about one of the hardest problems in mathematics — the Navier–Stokes equations — and how DeepMind, together with leading mathematicians, is using AI to explore it in a completely new way.

For more than a century, the Navier–Stokes equations have described how fluids move — water in a river, air around a wing, plasma inside a star. They are among the most successful equations in all of physics, yet they hide a mystery so deep that the Clay Mathematics Institute, in May 2000, made this problem one of its seven Millennium Prize Problems in mathematics. It offered a one-million-dollar prize for anyone who can prove a single statement about them: do smooth solutions always exist, or can they blow up in finite time?

It sounds simple: can turbulence create an infinite whirlpool, a singularity where velocity or pressure becomes infinite? But proving or disproving it has defeated generations of mathematicians. The equations are nonlinear, coupled, and so sensitive that even a small numerical error can lead to chaos.

This year, DeepMind and an international group of researchers led by mathematician Javier Gómez Serrano have taken a bold step. Instead of searching for analytical proofs by hand, they are building AI models that explore the equation’s landscape — systems that can discover new patterns, new potential singularities, and even new families of solutions that humans have never seen before.

In a recent report published on DeepMind’s blog, the team describes how they used physics-informed neural networks, or PINNs, to simulate fluid behavior with extremely high precision. Unlike traditional neural networks that only learn from data, these models are constrained by the physical laws themselves: the Navier–Stokes equations are literally encoded into their loss function. When the network predicts a velocity or pressure field, the system penalizes it unless it satisfies the differential equations point by point.

By combining this with second-order optimization and adaptive mesh refinement, the DeepMind team reached numerical accuracies that they describe as “beyond what was previously possible.” One analogy they use is measuring the diameter of the Earth with an error of only a few centimeters — that’s how fine their spatial resolution became.

What did they find?
They discovered entire families of unstable, self-similar solutions that act like precursors to turbulence. In mathematical language, these are candidates for “blow-up” — points in space and time where quantities like vorticity might diverge. Some of these solutions occur not only in Navier–Stokes, but also in related systems such as the Boussinesq equations and the incompressible porous-media equations. These analogs help researchers test which types of singularity behaviors are general and which are unique to certain kinds of fluid flow.

To interpret what the AI was finding, DeepMind’s scientists didn’t just trust the network’s outputs. They partnered with mathematicians like Gómez Serrano, who has worked for years with collaborators such as Terence Tao and Alexandru Ionescu on analytical approaches to fluid singularities. Their joint goal is not to “prove the Millennium Problem” immediately, but to map the terrain — to identify which configurations are worth formal mathematical attention.

In interviews, Gómez Serrano describes this as a symbiosis: the AI explores vast spaces of potential behaviors, and human mathematicians test which ones are rigorous enough to pursue. He compares it to astronomy: the AI is the telescope revealing new constellations of behavior in the equations, but the human still has to interpret what those constellations mean.

The collaboration between DeepMind and Gómez Serrano’s group formally began in early 2025, though discussions had been going on for several years. About twenty researchers are involved, combining expertise in analysis, computation, and machine learning. The project operates in what they describe as “semi-confidential mode,” because some of the candidate results could lead to publications with major mathematical implications.

So far, the results have not produced a complete proof, but they have revealed what DeepMind calls new solutions to century-old problems in fluid dynamics. The AI identified patterns of instability that were previously unknown, and the team verified them using both numerical analysis and symbolic reasoning tools. In particular, they used automatic differentiation to estimate the growth rates of vorticity and energy density near critical points, giving them a new way to quantify when and how singularities might appear.

Why is this important? Because the existence of singularities would mean that fluid motion can become mathematically undefined — that under certain conditions, our equations for air, water, and even blood flow would literally cease to make sense. In practical terms, it could change the way we understand turbulence, weather prediction, and even fusion plasma control. But even if no singularities exist, proving their absence would also be monumental: it would show that the equations describing almost all macroscopic fluid motion are perfectly well behaved for all time.

Beyond mathematics, the project is also a test case for something larger: can AI help tackle open theoretical problems, not by brute force, but by reasoning within the constraints of known laws? The DeepMind team sees this as part of their long-term agenda — to create systems that can collaborate with mathematicians and physicists at the frontier of what is knowable. It’s the same spirit that drove their earlier work with AlphaFold, which solved the protein-folding problem. Now the focus has shifted from biology to the purest realm of mathematical physics.

The effort also revives philosophical questions about what it means to “understand.” If a neural network finds a valid singular solution, but no human can express it analytically, has the problem really been solved? Or does true understanding require that the reasoning can be written down in human symbols? DeepMind acknowledges this tension and is working on symbolic regression pipelines that translate the network’s numerical findings into interpretable formulas — equations humans can read, manipulate, and prove.

Interestingly, this exploration has already led to collaborations beyond DeepMind. Independent groups are using similar AI-assisted methods to analyze fluid instabilities in astrophysics, oceanography, and turbulence modeling. Some are adapting graph neural networks to represent velocity fields as evolving graphs, which may help capture the topology of vortex interactions. Others are combining reinforcement learning with spectral solvers to teach AI agents how to stabilize turbulent flow in simulations.

The Navier–Stokes problem remains unsolved, but something profound is happening. The frontier of mathematical discovery — once the domain of blackboards and intuition — is now becoming a dialogue between computation and thought. The machines are not replacing mathematicians; they are expanding the landscape of what can be imagined and tested.

In the end, whether DeepMind’s collaboration ultimately claims the million-dollar prize or not may be less important than what it teaches us about the scientific process itself. AI is not just calculating; it’s beginning to hypothesize, to explore, and to generate structures that invite human interpretation. In that sense, the search for Navier–Stokes smoothness is not only about fluids — it’s a metaphor for the future of science: dynamic, nonlinear, and occasionally turbulent, but always flowing toward deeper understanding.

That’s all for this special edition of Prompt Science. In our next episode, we’ll explore how similar AI-assisted reasoning is being applied to cosmology and the search for new physical laws. Until then, keep your mind open — and your equations stable.
